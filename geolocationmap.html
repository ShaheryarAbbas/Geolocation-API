    <h1>Geo Location</h1>
    Geolocation or Geographical location refers to a position on the Earth. Your absolute geographic location is defined by two
    coordinates,longitude and latitude. Longitude and Latitude can be defined on the globe with vertical and horizontal lines
    respectively. These two coordinates can be used to give specific locations independent of an outside reference point.
    <h2>Geolocation API(Aplication Program Interfece</h2>
    The Geolocation API allows the user to provide their location to web applications if they so desire. For privacy reasons,
    the user is asked for permission to report location information.
    <h3>Concepts and usage</h3>
    The Geolocation API is accessed via a call to navigator.geolocation; this will cause the user's browser to ask them for
    permission to access their location data. If they accept, then the browser will use the best available functionality on
    the device to access this information (for example, GPS).
    The developer can now access this location information in a couple of different ways:
    Geolocation.getCurrentPosition(): Retrieves the device's current location.
    Geolocation.watchPosition(): Registers a handler function that will be called automatically each time the position of the
    device changes, returning the updated location.
    <h4>Window</h4>
    Window is the main and most important object in the browser. It respresents browser's window. Window has many properties
    and methods. Everything is stored in the window. Console.log(window) shows everything stored in the window.
    <h5>Navigator</h5>
    Navigator is an object that retreaves information. Navigator in JavaScript is an object that provides details about the 
    browser that the user uses to access the web-application.
